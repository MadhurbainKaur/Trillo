# Trillo
Trillo website created from a Udemy course on Advanced CSS and SASS taught by [@jonasschmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann). 

This project focuses on using flexbox to create the layout of the website, implementing custom CSS properties, and continuing to use BEM methodology for the architecture. Using and manipulating SVG icons instead of font-icons is introduced and the desktop-first approach is also continued throughout the Trillo project. Furthermore, advanced responsive design elements such as using design breakpoints for the media queries, consistently using relative units, and other healthy CSS practices are also applied across the CSS code.
